			<p> My name is <strong>Melanie Greene</strong>. I attend <em>Pace University </em>in New York City, yes the city that never sleeps. The capital of the world. I am a junior studying information technology with a concentration in web design and digital media. I also have a minor in marketing. </p>

			<p> I am belong to the <a href = "http://www.pace.edu/seidenberg/"> Seidenberg School of Computer Science and Information Systems </a>. My home away from home. #SeidenbergPride </p>

			<p> I have taken so many great classes. I have learned how to use <em>SQL</em> and create a database in my Database Management course, explored <em>Java</em> in my Introduction to Programming I course, experienced <em>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</em> in Web Design and Digital media, among many others. </p>

			<p> Entering college I was so undecided. I had no idea what I wanted to pursue. Where did I see myself? It was rough. In my Fall 2014 semester I took the following classes:</p>
			<p id="classes"></p>
			<!--w3schools inspired -->
			<script>
			 	var class1 ="Introduction to Programming I"
			 	var class2 ="Web Design and Digital Media"
			 	var class3 ="Web Design for Non-Profits" 
			 	document.getElementById("classes").innerHTML = class1 + ", "+ class2 + ", and " + class3 + ".";
			 </script>

			
			<p>And..... I discovered something. Something I never knew I could do. I liked learning how to code. I felt like I was discovering me. It was eye opening. </p>
			
	

			<p> My Web Design for Non-Profits course changed my life. I worked with an individual who had a disability (Down Syndrome) to create a project based on his interests and abilities. We made a video game using an app on the iPad called GamePress and documented our time together by creating an iMovie.</p>

			<p> This experience blossomed my passion for giving back to others. I have worked as a mentor for two different individuals on the Autism Spectrum where I identified educational technologies tailored to address the respective communication challenges of two students. I utilized games to expand vocabulary and improve word usage for both students. </p>

			<p> Over this past summer I worked on a research project with my professor. We researched wearable devices that would enable individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities to proactively manage their health care choices. </p>
